# The Data Scientist Mind Map
A mind map created using the FreeMind software. It contains links to codes, articles, templates and much more.

## What is FreeMind?
See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMind#cite_note-1) Wikipedia article.

## How to download the software?
- This can be downloaded directly from (MacOS) [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freemind/)
- My FreeMind map does not render well in **macOS Monterey**. Read this [blog](https://rosshall.online/writing/how-to-fix-freemind-after-macos-monterey-update/) to fix this issue.
